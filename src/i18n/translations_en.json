        "DESCRIPTION" : "<p>Let us go as far back as the Jurassic period, 140 million years ago at the time of the dinosaurs.</p><p>The whole of the region was submerged under a warm and not very deep sea.</p><p>During the formation of the Alps (65 million years ago) the sea receded.</p><p>This uncovered all the usual forms of sediment that cover a sea bed which were transformed into rock over thousands of years.</p><p>This was the origin of the limestone that today covers the whole region.</p><p>Limestone is a sedimentary rock that is often at the origin of many cave formations.</p><p>2 million years ago (the start of the Quaternary period and the dawn of Homo Erectus), the earth’s climate started to change and the first ice-ages began, interspersed by warmer inter-glacial periods. Almost all of northern Europe, including the centre of France, was covered by gigantic glaciers.</p><p>The last ice-age lasted 80&nbsp;000 years and ended around 12&nbsp;000 years ago.</p><p>The present day period is a warm inter- glacial period.</p><p>The glaciers melted little by little and lakes were formed (Leman, Annecy, Bourget, Nantua) and also some rivers.</p><p>A long time ago, a river used to flow through this area. You are going to follow its path, from its entrance, to where it reappeared in the middle of a cliff face. It represents the perfect example of how the climate can shape the landscape.</p><h3>How does water shape the rock and form galleries?</h3><p>Limestone has two principal characteristics:</p><ul><li>it is full of cracks (or joints)</li><li>it dissolves when in contact with water that contains carbonic acid</li></ul><p>This has two effects:</p><ul><li><strong>a chemical reaction</strong>: water seeps into the joints and dissolves the limestone, widening the cracks,</li><li><strong>a mechanical reaction</strong>: the water carries sand, pebbles, grit, stones, etc which rub against the cracks and increase the effects of erosion of the limestone.</li></ul><p>Together, the two actions lead to the creation of underground galleries like the one we are in now.</p>",

The river was deviated up and it formed this chimney that is between 10 and 13 metres high.</p><p>As the level of the nearby lake fell, there was not enough water in the river to allow it to push up through the surface.</p>",

During an inter-glacial period, the increase in volume of the water washed away the deposits leaving the table suspended to the rock face</p>",

Many animal bones have been found here. But it was never lived in because of the cold.</p><p>In 1930, a cheese-maker decided to mature his cheeses here (a cheese called the Bleu de Gex). He fitted shelves and a winch to raise and lower the cheeses from the surface which were then transported in small carts on rails. He stopped in the 1950s with the arrival of industrial cold storage techniques.</p><p>The cheese-maker himself opened the upper gallery to the public.</p>",
